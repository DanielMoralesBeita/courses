### Finishing the project

We haven't spent much time on the résumé; that's okay, because now you know everything you need to to get working on it! See what you can do, and try to incorporate a library like [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) or [D3JS](http://d3js.org/) to make it super-cool!

I have my own project (warning: it sucks and I didn't bother to do any extra credit) included with these notes for reference if you get stuck.

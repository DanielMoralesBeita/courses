###Setting up the Virtual Machine

Provided is a pre-configured virtual machine with Hadoop already set up and ready to go with sample data sets. This note will cover the setup and basic usage of the machine.

**Downloading the VM and data sets**

1. Download the virtual machine from [here](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.udacity-data.com%2Fcourses%2Fud617%2FCloudera-Udacity-Training-VM-4.1.1.c.zip&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG99mmdUdf-sIzzbco3UVlc9D1q6g). Make sure you have enough disk space, as it is 5 GB in size when unzipped.
2. Unzip it!

**VM Setup**

1. First, download and install [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Create a new Ubuntu Linux machine, and for the Hard Drive, select "Choose and existing" and pick the Cloudera-Training vmdk file. More detailed instructions are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0zGBZ6EHap-Smsr3x3sGGpDW-54m82kDpPKC2M6uiY/edit?usp=sharing).
3. Run the new VM!

**Playing around**

See these two YouTube videos for a demo on the VM:

* [Using HDFS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I_2nyPNZM)
* [Simplifying things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5TZ_2I7dwE)

Also, read [this](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.2.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html) for a detailed tutorial on HDFS commands. If you need to transfer files back and forth between your machine and the VM, read [this](https://docs.google.com/a/knowlabs.com/document/d/1MZ_rNxJhR4HCU1qJ2-w7xlk2MTHVqa9lnl_uj-zRkzk/pub).

Have fun playing around with the VM! Things are going to ramp up in terms of difficulty quickly in the next lessons, so be prepared to use external resources a lot.

### Where do versions come from?

One way of saving different versions of a file is to manually create new files every now and then with the content from the file you're working in. This is really tedious, and not exactly feasible for a project with thousands of files, like [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).

How else could we get versions of our files? You've probably already seen version control before:

* Google Drive
    * Google Drive will let you see all revisions that have been made to a file
* Wikipedia
    * You can click the "view history" button on any Wikipedia article to see changes that have been made.
    * Try it out [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scotland&action=history)!
    
### Version Control for Code

* Google Drive
    * 
* Dropbox
    * 
* Wikipedia
    * 
* Doing it manually

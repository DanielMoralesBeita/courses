#Intro to Computer Science

**Udacity: CS 101**

---

###Introduction to the Course

* Instructor: [Dave Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/), Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia
* Goals:
  * Become familiar with the fundamentals of computer science
  * Read and write computer programs
* Final Project: Build a web crawler

###What is Computer Science?

Dave's definition:

> "Computer science is about how to solve problems, like building a search engine, by breaking them into smaller pieces, then preciesely and mechanically describing a sequence of steps that can be used to solve each piece."

One way to break up the problem of building a search engine: 

1. Find data by crawling web pages
2. Build an index to be able to respond quickly to queries
3. Ranking pages to deliver the best results

###The Web Crawler

A web crawler is a program that collects content from the web. It finds web pages by starting from a *seed page* (a pre-selected page), and following links to find other pages until it has found many web pages.

###What is Programming?

Most machines are designed to do one thing. For example, a toaster would need to be drastically altered to do anything other than make toast.

Unlike a toaster, a computer is a *universal machine* that can be programmed to perform almost any computation.

A *program* is just a precisely defined sequence of steps that allow the computer to:

* Serve web pages
* Play video games
* Make music
* Become a tax calculator
* etc...

###Python

There are many different languages for programming computers. Python is a [high-level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) and [interpreted](http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Interpreted_language.html) language that is very friendly to beginners.

* Python Facts
  * Contrary to popular belief, Python is not named after a type of snake. It is in fact named after [Monty Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE), the popular BBC comedy series.
  * Inspired by the [ABC language](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/) and designed by [Guido Van Rossum](https://www.python.org/~guido/), it was released to the world in February 1991.
  * Here's a short list of places you'll see Python used:
    * Reddit 
    * Dropbox
    * YouTube
    * BitTorrent
    * Google (in various places)
    * Spotify
    * Instagram

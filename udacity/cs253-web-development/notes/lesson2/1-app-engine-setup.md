### Lesson 2: Forms and User Input

**Getting set up with App Engine**

Welcome to lesson 2! We'll be building our first web application in this unit, but first, you need to get set up with Google App Engine. I won't include detailed instructions, because you can find out how to install it and configure things on [the App Engine website](https://developers.google.com/appengine/).

We will be using the Python 2.7 runtime, for reference.

Once you're set up, we can make our first app by following the [Hello World](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/introduction) tutorial online.

Once you've done that and have successfully run the program on your development web server, continue on in the notes!

In case you struggle with the setup, be sure to look around YouTube; there are some very good videos that cover everything from making your account to deploying your App Engine app.

Good luck!

### Lesson 2: Forms and User Input

**Getting set up with App Engine**

Welcome to lesson 2! We'll be building our first web application in this unit, but first, you need to get set up with Google App Engine. I won't include detailed instructions, because you can find out how to install it and configure things on [the App Engine website](https://developers.google.com/appengine/).

We will be using the Python 2.7 runtime, for reference.

Once you're set up, we can make our first app by following the [Hello World](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/introduction) tutorial online.

Once you've done that and have successfully run the program on your development web server, continue on in the notes!

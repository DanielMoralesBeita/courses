#Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce

**Udacity: UD 617**

###Lesson 4: MapReduce Design Patterns

At this point in the course, we've covered the basics of how Hadoop works, and written a bunch of MapReduce code. However, what we haven't gone over is:

1. When to use Hadoop to solve a problem
2. Common types of problems and how to write MapReduce to solve them

That's what this lesson is for! By the end of this lesson, you'll have "boilerplate" MapReduce code that can be turned back to if you're ever struggling with a problem!

So, what patterns will we learn about?

* Filtering patterns
    * Getting a sample of a large data set
    * Making a "Top 10"-type list of anything
* Summarization patterns
    * Counting records
    * Finding min, max, mean, etc.
    * Creating an index
* Structural patterns
    * Combining two data sets

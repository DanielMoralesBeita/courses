#Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce

**Udacity: UD 617**

###Final Project: Part 3

We are interested seeing what are the top tags used in posts. Write a mapreduce program that would output Top 10 tags, ordered by the number of questions they appear in.

For an extra challenge you can think how to get a top 10 list of tags, where they are ordered by some weighted score by your choice.

Please note that you should only look at tags appearing in questions themselves (i.e. nodes with node_type "question"), not on answers or comments.

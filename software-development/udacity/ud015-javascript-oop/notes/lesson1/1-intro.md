# Object-Oriented JavaScript

**Udacity: UD 015**

---

### Intro to the course

Welcome to Object-Oriented JavaScript! This course is designed to teach web developers how to utilize the various object-oriented programming features within JavaScript, and more importantly, how to write reusable and maintainable libraries that will make your life easier.

Here's some basic info about the course:

* Instructor: [Marcus Phillips](http://www.hackreactor.com/team/) of Hack Reactor (formerly Twitter)
* Topics covered:
    * Scopes & Closures
    * The "this" keyword
    * Prototype delegation
    * Writing reusable and maintainable code
* Final project: JavaScript version of the classic Frogger game

### Prerequisites and Requirements

This course is for beginner to intermediate web developers with an understanding of JavaScript syntax. Specifically, you should know how to write control structures, how to write simple functions, and recognize the different variable types in JavaScript, as well as be able to read existing JavaScript code with these features and predict its outcome.

### Syllabus

**Lesson 1: Scopes and Closures**

We’ll start by discussing JavaScript’s functional variable scoping features, including lexical scopes (variable availability as you write your code) and dynamics scopes (variable availability as your code actively runs). We’ll then discuss closures, an often misunderstood but incredibly useful feature available in only a handful of languages, including JavaScript.

**Lesson 2: The Keyword “this”**

You’ll start your dive into JavaScript object-oriented features by first discovering the parameter “this”. You’ll learn how the value of “this” is determined within various code structures and why it might be a lot easier to think of “this” as a parameter rather than a keyword.

**Lesson 3: Prototype Delegation**

You’re probably using one of JavaScript’s inheritance models already: prototype delegation! In this lesson you’ll learn more about this unique feature of JavaScript, how JavaScript uses this feature internally and how you can take advantage of it to maximize your application’s memory footprint.

**Lesson 4: Code Reuse**

There are numerous ways to write concise, maintainable and reusable code in JavaScript and you’ll practice a number of them in this lesson. We’ll start writing a library using basic functions and learn the decorator pattern. Then, we’ll refactor this library into the functional, prototypal and pseudoclassical inheritance models. Finally, we’ll explore sub-classing -- coding objects that directly inherit from objects we’ve previously defined.

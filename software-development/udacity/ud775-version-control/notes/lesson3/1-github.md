# Version Control

**Udacity: UD 775**

Now that we've gone over the basics of version control, it's time to learn about
sharing and collaborating with others! There are many ways to do this, but we
will focus on one tool called GitHub.

### GitHub

GitHub is a website that makes it easy to share code with others. GitHub, as the
name suggests, will host your git repositories for you.

The service is free for public repos, and you can create an account
[here](https://github.com).

Here's an example of a repository from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/create-your-own-adventure).
Clicking that link will take you to a place where you can do a bunch of things:

* View the source files
* Report bugs and other issues with the code
* "Star" the repository if you like it
* See who has collaborated on the project
* Look at previous versions of the code
* "Fork" the project to work on it and then submit a "Pull request" to offer your own fixes and features to the project

There are some very famous projects on GitHub:

* [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
* [Angular JS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)

Definitely check them out!

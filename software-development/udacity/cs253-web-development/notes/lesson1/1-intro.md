### Lesson 1: How the web works

This unit will focus on some of the basics of the web:

* What is the web?
* HTML
* URLs
* HTTP
* Web applications

These 5 sections will be broken off into their own sets of notes. For now, let's focus on the web and what it is.

### World Wide Web

The world wide web, a.k.a. "the web", is a collection of documents. These documents are generally made up of something called HTML, or "HyperText Markup Language".

Although documents of any type can be on the web (mp3, mp4, docx, etc.), HTML is the glue that holds everything together. The links between these HTML pages, called "HyperLinks", is what makes the web "web-like". They are what allow me to go to one page, click a link, and end up on another one.

Some fun facts about the web:

* Invented by [Tim Berners-Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) in the 1980s.
* The web and the Internet are not the same thing! The web is simply a service that runs on the Internet, just like email.
* The web was originally proposed as a more efficient means of communication within [CERN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN).
* Any type of file that can be stored on a computer can be accessed on the Internet.

The major pieces of the web are:

1. Your browser: makes requests to servers via the Internet using a protocol called HTTP
2. The Internet: the world's largest computer network
3. Servers: computers (just like your own) optimized for storing files and running reliably for long periods of time

Let's move on to HTML in the next set of notes!
